We have considered internal wave beam interaction with a  a topography with a Gaussian bump and associated wave reflection. 
In previous studies, the internal wave reflection from a free-slip surfaceand an arbitrary topography are analyzed. 
In these studies, the normal component of the internal wave velocity  field to the surface normal is set to zero.
In the analysis presented here, the same boundary condition is applied to a topography with a Gaussian bump with arbitrary location, height and half width.
In addition to the previous studies, the Gaussian bump also generates a perturbation in the internal wave field. 
In the problem analyzed here, the perturbation in the internal wave field  are used to estimate the parameter related to the Gaussian topography which are the location of the center of the bump, the height of the bump and the half width of the bump.

The matlab solver provided here generates a wave beam with Gaussian profile propagating downwards and interating with the topography.
